    <p>Synthesizers are found in almost every genre of music.  On top of that they are far from simple.  
        I decided to choose the Juno-106 as my image map.  I thought it would be cool link some of the functions 
      of the juno to web pages explaining what they're used for.</p>
    
    <p>LFO's are one of the most important parts of synthesis.  They give sounds motion which sounds intersting.  They're one of the foundations of sound design.  
    Portamento is another cool feature in many instruments. It gives some nice character to each key played.  I decided to place a link on the Arpeggion section because 
    of how often they're used in music.  Used in combonation with the High Pass Filter is always a nice touch.</p>
    
    <p>I chose all of the other mapping links just to get some information on what they do.  Idealy I would have put a mapping link on every slider and knob, but you get the idea.
    Synthesis is complex and takes a lot of practice and knowledge to really understand.  I'm still fairly new to it so I've got a long ways to go.  Other than that, I think Synthesizers are
    just simply nice to look at. </p>
